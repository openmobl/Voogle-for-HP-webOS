Name: Voogle for HP webOS
Made by: Connor LaCombe
Type: HP webOS Application and PHP API

Fair warning: The source code is very messy, plenty of bugs and a lot has to be re-written due to Google changing their design on their Google Voice page (yes, it matters and you're head will explode when you see why).

I don't really know what license or whatever to use with this so just do whatever you want, it's open source.
